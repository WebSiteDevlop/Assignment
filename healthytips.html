 	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter your age, it’s important to take care of your body and prevent illness.
But if you’re 65 or older, something as simple as the flu or a common cold can progress and lead to complications.
 This includes secondary infections like pneumonia, bronchitis, an ear infection, or a sinus infection. 
 If you have a chronic condition such as asthma or diabetes, a respiratory illness can make these worse.
Because of this, it’s important to make healthy choices to strengthen your immune system and reduce the likelihood of illness.<br>

	    <ul>
			<li><b>Eat a healthy diet</b>:<br>
			Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean meats also give your immune system a boost and protect against harmful viruses and bacteria that cause illnesses. Fruits and vegetables are a good source of antioxidants. Antioxidants protect your cells from damage and keep your body healthy.
			You should also limit your consumption of sugary and fatty foods, which can trigger inflammation in the body and lower your immune system.

			<li><b>Wash your hands frequently</b>:<br>
		Washing your hands on a regular basis is another excellent way to stay healthy year-round. Viruses can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours. It’s possible to become ill if you touch a virus-covered surface and contaminate your hands, and then touch your face.
		Wash your hands with warm soapy water often, and for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your nose, face, and mouth with your hands.
		You can also protect yourself by using antibacterial hand sanitizer.

	    <ul>
			<li><b>Learn how to manage stress</b>:<br>
			Chronic stress increases your body’s production of the stress hormone cortisol. Too much cortisol can disrupt different functions in your body, including your immune system.
			To reduce stress, increase physical activity, get plenty of sleep, set reasonable expectations for yourself, and explore relaxing, enjoyable activities.

	    <ul>
			<li><b>Get plenty of rest</b>:<br>
			Not only can sleep reduce your stress level, but sleep is how your body repairs itself. For this reason, getting an adequate amount of sleep can result in a stronger immune system, making it easier for your body to fight off viruses.
			Sleep is also important as you get older because it can improve memory and concentration. Aim for at least seven and a half to nine hours of sleep per night.

			<li><b>Schedule annual physicals</b>:<br>	
		Scheduling a yearly checkup can also keep you healthy. Always speak with your doctor if you have concerns about your health.
		Conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure can go undetected. Regular physical examinations will enable your doctor to diagnose any problems early. Getting early treatment may prevent long-term complications.
		 The flu virus can lead to complications in adults over the age of 65.

			Another way to protect yourself year-round is to avoid being close to people who are sick. This is easier said than done. But if there’s a flu outbreak in your area, limit contact with people who aren’t feeling well and avoid crowded areas until conditions improve.
